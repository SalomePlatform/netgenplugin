\mainpage Introduction to NETGENPLUGIN

\b NETGENPLUGIN plugin is destined for:
- Meshing 1D, 2D and 3D geometric entities.
  - Faces are split into triangular elements. Quad-dominant mesh is
  also possible.
  - Solids are split into tetrahedral elements. Pyramids are
  constructed as a transition from quadrangles to tetrahedra.
- Generating 3D meshes from 2D meshes, working without geometrical objects.

To manage parameters of the NETGENPLUGIN use 
\subpage netgen_2d_3d_hypo_page and \subpage additional_hypo_page.

Native Netgen mesher usually prints a lot of trace output to the terminal
window. This output is redirected to some log file by the Plugin. It
is possible to switch off this redirection by setting up
KEEP_NETGEN_OUTPUT environment variable.

Also all NETGENPLUGIN functionalities are accessible via
\subpage netgenplugin_python_interface_page "NETGENPLUGIN Python interface".
