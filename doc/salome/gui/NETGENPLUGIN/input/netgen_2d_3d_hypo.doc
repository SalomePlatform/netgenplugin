<b>NETGEN 2D Parameters</b> and <b>NETGEN 3D  Parameters</b> hypotheses work only with
<b>NETGEN 1D-2D</b>, <b>NETGEN 2D</b>, <b>NETGEN 1D-2D-3D</b> and
<b>NETGEN 3D</b> algorithms. <b>NETGEN 1D-2D</b> and <b>NETGEN
1D-2D-3D</b>  algorithms do not require definition of lower-level
hypotheses and algorithms (2D and 1D for meshing 3D objects and 1D for
meshing 2D objects).

<center><em>Dialog boxes of <b>NETGEN 2D</b> and <b>NETGEN 3D</b>
    algorithms </em></center>

- <b>Name</b> - allows to define the name for the algorithm (NETGEN
2D (or 3D) Parameters by default).
- <b>Max Size</b> - maximum linear dimensions for mesh cells.
- <b>Min Size</b> - minimum linear dimensions for mesh cells. It is
ignored if it is more than <b>Max Size</b>.
- <b>Second Order</b> - if this box is checked in, the algorithm will
create second order mesh.
- <b>Fineness</b> - ranging from <em>Very Coarse</em> to <em>Very Fine</em>
allows to set the level of meshing detalization using the three
parameters below. You can select \a Custom to define them manually.
- <b>Growth rate</b> - allows to define how much the linear dimensions of
two adjacent cells can differ (e.g. 0.3 means 30%).
- <b>Nb. Segs per Edge</b> - allows to define the minimum number of
mesh segments in which edges will be split. This parameter is used
only if <b>Limit Size by Surface Curvature</b> is checked.
- <b>Nb Segs per Radius</b> - allows to define the size of
mesh segments and mesh faces in which curved edges and surfaces will
be split. This value divided by a radius of curvature gives an element
size at a given point. This parameter is used only if <b>Limit Size by
  Surface Curvature</b> is checked.
- <b>Limit Size by Surface Curvature</b> - if this box is checked in,
then size of mesh segments and mesh faces on curved edges and surfaces
is defined using value of <b>Nb Segs per Radius</b> parameter, and
number of segments on straight edges is defined by values of
<b>Nb. Segs per Edge</b> parameter. (<b>Growth rate</b> is also taken
into account.) If this box is not checked in, then size of elements is
defined by three parameters only:
<b>Max Size</b>, <b>Min Size</b> and <b>Growth rate</b>.
- <b>Allow Quadrangles</b> - if this box is checked in, the mesher
tries to generate quadrangle 2D mesh. Triangle elements are created
where quadrangles are not possible.
- <b>Optimize</b> - if this box is checked in, the algorithm will modify
initially created mesh in order to improve quality of elements. Optimization
process is rather time consuming comparing to creation of initial mesh.
- <b>Fuse Coincident Nodes on Edges and Vertices</b> - allows merging
mesh nodes on vertices and edges which are geometrically coincident
but are topologically different.

- <b>Local sizes</b> - allows to define size of elements on and
around specified geometrical objects. To define the local
size it is necessary to select a geometrical objects in the
object browser or in the viewer, and to click a button corresponding
to the type of the geometrical objects: <b>On Vertex</b>, <b>On
  Edge</b> etc. <b>Name</b> of the geometrical object and a
default <b>Value</b> will be added in the table where the <b>Value</b>
can be changed.
- <b>Remove</b> - deletes a selected row from the table.
- <b>Mesh-size File</b> - opens a dialog to select a file defining
size of elements. The file includes two obligatory sections. The first
section defines the size at points. The second section defines the
size along lines. Let's consider the following sample size file.
\code
2
92.5 92.5 92.5 0.05
42.5 42.5 42.5 0.04
1
25 25 0 25 25 200  0.3
\endcode
"2" at the first line means that there are two points in the first
section.<br>
"92.5 92.5 92.5 0.05" at the second line means that at the point with
coordinates (92.5, 92.5, 92.5) size of elements should be 0.05.<br>
"1" at the fourth line means that there is one line in the second
section.<br>
"25 25 0 25 25 200  0.3" means that along the line between points (25,
25, 0) and (25, 25, 200) size of elements should be 0.3.

<b>NETGEN 2D simple parameters</b> and <b>NETGEN 3D simple
parameters</b> allow defining the size of elements for each
dimension.

\b 1D group allows defining the size of 1D elements in either of two ways: 
- <b>Number of Segments</b> allows specifying number of segments, that
will split each edge, with equidistant distribution.
- <b>Local Length</b> defines length of segments.

\b 2D group allows defining the size of 2D elements 
- <b>Length from edges</b> if checked in, size of 
2D mesh elements is defined as an average mesh segment length
for a given wire, else
- <b>Max. Element Area</b> specifies expected maximum element area for
each 2d element.
- <b>Allow Quadrangles</b> - allows to generate quadrangle elements
wherever possible.

\b 3D groups allows defining the size of 3D elements.
- <b>Length from faces</b> if checked in, the area of sides of
volumic elements will be equal to an average area of 2D elements, else
- <b>Max. Element Volume</b> specifies expected maximum element volume
of 3d elements.

\note NETGEN algorithm does not strictly follow the input
parameters. The actual mesh can be more or less dense than
required. There are several factors in it:
- NETGEN does not actually use <b>Number of Segments</b> parameter for
discretization of edge. This parameter is used  only to define the
local element size (size at the given point), so local sizes of
close edges influence each other.
- NETGEN additionally restricts the element size according to edge curvature.
- The local size of segments influences the size of close triangles.
- The order of elements and their size in the 1D mesh generated by
NETGEN differ from those in the 1D mesh generated by Regular_1D
algorithm, resulting in different 2D and 3D meshes.
