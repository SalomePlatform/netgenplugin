\page additional_hypo_page Additional Hypotheses

\n <b>Additional Hypotheses</b> can be applied as a supplement to
introducing additional concepts to mesh creation.

Following additional hypotheses can be used together with NETGEN algoritm:
<ul>

<li><b>Viscous Layers</b> additional hypothesis can be used together with NETGEN 3D.
This hypothesis allows creation of layers of highly stretched prisms near
mesh boundary, which is beneficial for high quality viscous
computations. The prisms constructed on the quadrangular mesh faces are
actually the hexahedrons.</li>

<li><b>Quadrangle Preference</b> - This additional hypothesis can be
  used together with NETGEN 2D algorithm.
It allows NETGEN 2D to build quad-dominant meshes.</li>
</ul>
<br>

For more detailed description of the described above hypothesis please refer SALOME Mesh User's Guide.
